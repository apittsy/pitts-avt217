    <p>3. Create one circle. Makes its width and height your age times 10.</p>
    <p>4. Place the circle touching one of the four corners of the artboard depending on your favorite season.

      <ul>summer: bottom-left</ul>
      <ul>fall: bottom-right</ul>
    </p>
    <p>5. If your birth month is an odd number, color the circle in periwinkle. If even, color it sage. Remove its border.</p>
